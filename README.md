## How to run CVtoHTML! ##

### First ###

Make sure you are in a python environment either your global one or a venv.

It is important to use a python version that is atleast 3.8 or later.

After doing so, then make sure to download django if you have not already:

`python -m pip install Django`

Then you may proceed to `git clone` this repository and access it through the terminal ( or whatever method you like best)


### Second ###
After setting up your environment and navigating to the cloned repository, please go to the CVtoHTML folder (the one with manage.py in it)

and run the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

The server should start and my resume will be viewable through this url:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

and voila! my resume~

Thanks for viewing!
